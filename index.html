  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might imagine we use Chrome Dev Tools quite a bit at Hack Reactor.  Dev Tools has quickly become an indispensable tool for front-end work, but it&rsquo;s even more valuable as a debugging tool for your javascript programs.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t already use it in your debugging workflow (I&rsquo;m looking at you, chronic console.logger), approximately NOW would be a good time to learn.  I&rsquo;m going to use a simple bug scenario to introduce you to Dev Tools debugging.</p>

<p>Imagine we are given a problem to solve:</p>

<pre><code>// given an array, write a function that will, for every item in the array, 
// alert to the screen a string containing the item and the item's index in the array.
// you have been given a "loop" function, which takes an array and also 
// takes a function which will be called on every item in the array.

var example = ["a","b","c"];

var loop = function(array, iterator) {
  for (var i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++) {
    iterator(array[i]);
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>our solution:</p>

<pre><code>var alertArray = function(array) {
  loop(array, function(item, index){
    alert(item + " " + index);
  });
};
</code></pre>

<p>So let&rsquo;s run this solution.  I set up a simple html page and paste the code we wrote in a script.  I&rsquo;m going to invoke the function we wrote by adding <code>alertArray(example);</code> to my script.</p>

<p>When I open the page and the script runs I see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/devtools_post/alert1.png" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/devtools_post/alert2.png" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/devtools_post/alert3.png" /></p>

<p>Ruh-roh.  Where&rsquo;s the index?  You probably already know why it&rsquo;s not displaying, but I&rsquo;m going to use this simple scenario to demonstrate what a typical debugging workflow would look like.  A good question to ask yourself when you encounter a bug is &ldquo;what is the justification for my expectation that my code will run the way that I expect?</p>

<p>If you think you can identify a place where your expectation and the reality of the code (the bug) might diverge, enter a new line above that point and type <code>debugger;</code>  This will cause Chrome to pause execution at that line and wait for further instructions to proceed.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to type anything in your code you can set virtual debugger statements called breakpoints in Dev Tools â€“ one downside of breakpoints, though, is that if you change the number of lines in your code and run the script again, Chrome&rsquo;s breakpoints may wind up on lines that you didn&rsquo;t intend.
Here&rsquo;s what happens in Dev Tools (<code>command</code>+<code>option</code>+<code>i</code> in Chrome) when we run the code again with our debugger statement inserted:</p>

<p>(open images in new tab to see them at full size)
<img src="/images/devtools_post/debug1.png" /></p>

<p>Step over/into/out of are very handy tools that you will be using for potentially hours on end, so here are some more details on each:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>step over will proceed by a single line of code. If there is a function call in the executed line, step over will call the function and do whatever work is contained therein&hellip; but you will not see the execution of the function. Useful if you need to proceed through a function call that you are sure is not the source of your bug.</p></li>
<li><p>step into will also proceed by one line of code. If there is a function call it will transport you to the place in your code where that function call is actually running.  You will be able to inspect the internals (variables, etc) of that called function.</p></li>
<li><p>step out of does not &ldquo;rewind&rdquo; out of a function call (which the arrow pointing up may make you think at first), rather it will &ldquo;fast forward&rdquo; through the rest of a function (stepping over any other function calls contained therein) and return you to its parent function.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So to proceed I&rsquo;m going to click step over (or step into) to get to the beginning of line 18 (in the context of line 17 step over and step into will do the same thing since there&rsquo;s no function call on that line).</p>

<p>At the beginning of line 18 my console will look exactly the same.  Line 18, however, contains the call to the loop function, so I&rsquo;m going to click &ldquo;step into.&rdquo;  Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/devtools_post/debug2.png" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to click step over again to get to line 8, then I&rsquo;m going to click step into to go into my iterator call (in this case the anonymous function where I&rsquo;m alerting).  Here&rsquo;s what I see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/devtools_post/debug3.png" /></p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/devtools_post/debug4.png" /></p>

<p>For a problem this simple it may have seemed like overkill to use this debugging procedure in Dev Tools (especially when you can hit line 8 with a rock from line 19).
When your program gets big enough, though, that your functions call functions located in other files, or your recursive function has a bug somewhere in its 15th call to itself, Dev Tools will save your butt.</p>

<p>Practice this pattern!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>All About Prototypes</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all got baggage. Javascript is no exception. It just so happens that every single function that gets defined in Javascript comes with its own companion object called a prototype. This prototype object in most cases hangs around doing nothing at all (besides creating useless overhead). When it comes time to instantiate an object in Javascript, though, this prototype &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; offers powerful functionality.</p>

<p>Before we go further with prototypes let&rsquo;s delve into a little backstory, which unfortunately will include discovering some of the skeletons in Javascript&rsquo;s closet. In 1995 Netscape tasked employee Brendan Eich with developing a new scripting language for the Netscape browser. This language would be aimed at the then-exploding class of amateur programmers ready and eager to create websites that blinked, flashed, danced, jumped, and sang. This language was also supposed to be a direct competitor to Visual Basic (readers who associate Javascript with the current world of Node, Angular, and other coolier-than-thou environments might feel&hellip; perturbed, to put it mildly, about the last two sentences.  &hellip;I said there would be skeletons).</p>

<p>Under pressure to produce a working prototype of the language in a short amount of time, Brendan Eich grabbed some closures from Scheme, threw in a sweet prototype-based inheritance model inspired by Self, shrugged at or failed to notice a host of crippling idiosyncrasies (for example <code>alert(typeof NaN); //alerts 'Number' alert(NaN === NaN);  //evaluates false</code>), and called it a day.</p>

<p>Eich&rsquo;s bosses looked at the language, smiled and nodded politely, and told him to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it look more like Java. Java was the new hotness at the time and Netscape desperately wanted to leverage that hotness â€“ enough that they even decided to name the new language Javascript, again for reasons that were mostly arbitrary and marketing-related. So the end result was a scripting language misleadingly-named Javascript that included a bastardized version of prototypal inheritance featuring some Java-esque functionality stuck on with Elmer&rsquo;s glue.</p>

<p>Also, most of the aforementioned crippling idiosyncracies coasted through to the final version unfixed. <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-1996/idgns.java.1995/idgns.java.1995.114.html">This</a> is what the press release looked like (note the breathless mention of &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo;, which was true in only the hackiest of elmers-gluiest senses, and also the embarrassing mention of visual basic).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step over that skeleton clutching your ankle and move on!</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out already, Protypal inheritance is the pattern that attempts to return to Eich&rsquo;s original ideas, and Pseudo-classical is the pattern that makes use of the fake-object-oriented parts that got added to by his bosses.</p>

<h2>Prototypal</h2>

<pre><code>var Pizza = function(size) {
  var pizza = Object.create(Pizza.prototype);
  pizza.size = size;
  pizza.sauce = tomato;
  pizza.slices = 0

  return pizza;
}

Pizza.prototype.cheese = mozzarella;

Pizza.prototype.slice = function() {
  this.slices += 2;
  // slice in this case is a verb, not a noun.
}

var myPizza = Pizza(14)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember I said that a prototype was a companion object. One common (and understandable) source of confusion for Javascript beginners is that when they see &ldquo;Pizza.prototype&rdquo; they assume it refers to some sort of parent of the Pizza constructor. In fact, to stick with the familial analogy, Pizza.prototype is more like Pizza&rsquo;s invisible friend that we suddenly decided to start addressing by name (perhaps something a late-80s Steven Spielberg might have directed).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that the word &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; does in fact refer to a parent-child relationship â€“ it means that the <code>Pizza.prototype</code> object is intended to be a parent to any pizza instances that are created using the Pizza function, such as our example <code>myPizza</code> (<code>Object.create()</code> on line 27 is what actually sets that parent-child relationship in this pattern). This means that when we refer to <code>myPizza.cheese</code>, <code>myPizza</code>, finding that it has no immediate property named cheese, will ask its designated parent object if it has that property, and if does, return that property as if it was its own. Thus <code>myPizza.cheese</code> will return <code>mozazarella</code>.</p>

<p><em>PROS:</em> <br>
&ndash;    Good for memory management, since we only define the <code>slice</code> method and <code>cheese</code> property in one place and let all instantiated objects refer to those properties rather than owning their own copy (we are making the decision for now that all pizzas only need to use mozzarella cheese, which if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to experiment with cheddar as a substitue at home you will understand). <br>
â€“    Cleaner and safer than using mixins (which we looked at in Pt. 1) <br>
â€“    Supports subclassing (which we may get into in another post) <br>
â€“    Makes Brendan Eich feel good about his decisions in life? <br></p>

<p><em>CONS:</em> <br>
&ndash; Worse performance than other patterns in certain scenarios. <br>
&ndash; Different than typical OOP syntax &ndash; can cause mild-to-moderate confusion for beginners coming from &ldquo;classical&rdquo; languages.</p>

<h2>Pseudo-classical</h2>

<pre><code>var Pizza = function(size) {

  this.size = size;
  this.sauce = tomato;
  this.slices = 0;

}

Pizza.prototype.cheese = mozzarella;

Pizza.prototype.slice = function() {
  this.slices += 2;
}

var myPizza = new Pizza(14)
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with OOP this pattern will look the most familiar to you.  What may not be clear is how the pseudo-classical pattern is using prototypal inheritance under the hood. The easiest way to vizualize this is to mentally insert <code>this = Object.create(Pizza.prototype)</code> as the first line inside <code>Pizza</code> and then mentally insert <code>return this</code> as the last line in <code>Pizza</code>. This way the prototypal inheritance is established and the classical syntax is preserved (the use of the <code>new</code> keyword is what indicates to Javascript that this constructor function is intended to be used in the pseudoclassical style).</p>

<p><em>PROS:</em> <br>
&ndash; Familiar to classical programmers <br>
&ndash; Has been optimized for performance in certain scenarios <br></p>

<p><em>CONS:</em> <br>
&ndash; Ridiculous bugs can happen if you forget the <code>new</code> keyword <br>
&ndash; Obscures what is really happening behind the scenes in Javascript to acheive the inheritance it offers <br>
&ndash; Using this pattern when making subclasses (a category of constructed objects that delegates to another constructed category) can have serious downsides (I prefer a combination of this pattern with prototypal for subclassing â€“ I might do another post on the interesting challenges that subclassing poses in js).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! If you want to review the other two patterns you can find them <a href="http://georgebonnr.github.io/blog/2013/10/02/maker-patterns-pt-1/">here</a>.  Now go ahead and use these patterns to build your cats website. I was joking when I said it was dumb&hellip; it&rsquo;s gonna be great, people will love it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey kids!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about making things in Javascript.  I don&rsquo;t mean making your dumb cats website, I mean making things IN Javascript.  What are some useful ways to make (build / instantiate) things (objects) in the Javascript language?</p>

<p>For this post I&rsquo;m assuming that you&rsquo;re fairly new to Javascript, although you may have a little bit of programming experience in another language.</p>

<p>First of all, if you come from a language that handles object instantiation in a more conventional way (like Ruby or Java), you&rsquo;ve perhaps complained to yourself that Javascript is distressingly un-pretty and complicated in its implementation of classes and inheritance.  You would be right, especially in the case that you&rsquo;ve been trying to use Javascript in a Ruby-or-Java-like way.  However, Javascript more than makes up for this fugliness by offering significantly more power and flexibility in the ways you can create objects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate four different patterns for instantiating objects in Javascript. To keep things brief I&rsquo;ll only cover two functional patterns in this post, and in the next post I&rsquo;ll get into prototype chains in Javascript and prototype-based maker patterns. When it&rsquo;s all said and done you can choose whichever style you think will suit your project best.  If you have questions about the code used to make each example work (such as how Javascript uses the keyword <code>this</code>), you&rsquo;re welcome to email me with questions, or wait for an upcoming post on interesting Javascript artifacts (like <code>this</code>).</p>

<h2>Functional</h2>

<pre><code>var Pizza = function(size) {
  var pizza = {};
  pizza.size = size;
  pizza.cheese = mozzarella;
  pizza.sauce = tomato;
  pizza.slices = 0
  pizza.slice = function() {
    this.slices += 2;
    // slice in this case is a verb, not a noun.
  }

  return pizza;
}

var myPizza = Pizza(14)
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple.  You call this function, pass in a size, and you immediately get back a pizza object (our pizza-making factory is pretty quick).</p>

<p><em>PROS:</em> <br>
&ndash;   Simple and un-fussy. <br>
&ndash;   Supports functional programming style (which is a totally worthwhile thing to learn. If you&rsquo;re feeling ambitious check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg476048.aspx">this terrific article</a> on functional vs. object-oriented programming styles)</p>

<p><em>CONS:</em> <br>
&ndash; Each pizza comes with its own set of properties for all the things listed in the pizza object, including its own slice function (if you&rsquo;re wondering why that&rsquo;s a bad thing you will know in a second). <br>
&ndash; Also, if we want to make pizzas with different types of cheese or sauce (subclasses), we&rsquo;ll have to buid a second equally large pizza factory (not the most efficient thing in the world, although not quite as inefficient as OOP folks would have you believe).</p>

<h2>Functional with Mixins</h2>

<pre><code>var Pizza = function(size) {
  var pizza = {};
  pizza.size = size;
  pizza.cheese = mozzarella;
  pizza.sauce = tomato;
  pizza.slices = 0
  // this next line is a custom function we have written at the bottom of the example
  extend(pizza, slice)
  return pizza;
}

var slice =  {};
slice.slice = function() {
      this.slices += 2;
};

var extend = function(to, from) {
  for (var property in from) {
    to[property] = from[property]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand what the extend function is doing, just know that it&rsquo;s surveying whatever&rsquo;s in the slice object (in this case just a slicing function), and telling the pizza object to act like it can do whatever the slice object can do. This is called a mixin, and it&rsquo;s a pretty cool concept (some other languages have their own, different ways of doing mixins). <br>
You can do a wide variety things in Javascript with mixins &mdash; if you want to investigate further, check out <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/">this writeup</a>. If you&rsquo;re wondering if you can &ldquo;mix in&rdquo; the slice functionality into any object (like a pie), then you&rsquo;ve just discovered part of why mixins are so cool.</p>

<p><em>PROS:</em> <br>
&ndash; We&rsquo;ve solved the problem of each pizza having its own slicing mechanism (the problem was that each slicing function took up its own space in memory with each successive pizza. Now we have created a single slicing function that takes up only one space in memory and have told every pizza to refer to it when it needs to slice). <br/>
<em>CONS:</em> <br>
&ndash; Having a bunch of random objects floating around possibly getting mixed into other objects can be a messy way to work. What if you really only wanted just pizzas to be able to slice? What if you accidentally extended your pet snake object with slice (gross)? Mixins are powerful but can be dangerous in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>Next Post:
I&rsquo;ll get into prototypes in Javascript &ndash; what they are, how they came to be, and different ways you can use them to construct objects.  If you have any questions about anything in this post you can email me through my Github profile in the sidebar. Stay tuned!</p>
